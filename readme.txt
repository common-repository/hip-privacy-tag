Earn money from your site with the free HIP Profile System. Track your users responsibly and let them know you respect their privacy.

== Description ==

HIP is a brand new concept in online user privacy and data collection.  It is to data what AdSense is to ads.  The HIP Tag, now available as WordPress plugin, does two main things for your site/blog:

1. Allows you to collect behavioral data about your users and use that data to make immediate extra revenue from your site.
2. Informs your users that you respect their privacy rights and that through the HIP Tag any data you track about them is stored *only* on their local device and is possible to read and edit.

The HIP Tag brings you your very own scalable User Profile System.  It allows you to store pages your users are visiting on your site, as well as the META keywords of those sites.  It also allows you to store custom data, tags or anything your want.

You can then reference this data back later from your site, or from any other site you own.  That's right, it is cross-domain.

In addition to this you can make your HIP data available to advertisers and other interested sites.  This means a completely brand new revenue stream for your site without any additional work required on your part.

The tag can be hidden, or it can be shown as a widget in your WP theme.  When shown it creates a link back to The Human Information Project like this:

http://www.thehumaninformationproject.com?sf=your_domain_goes_here

When the user clicks they can then see the full listing of all the data you have added to their profile.  This results in fully transparent privacy practices for your site, and shows the user you have nothing to hide.

== Installation ==

1. Upload the entire hip-privacy folder to your wp-content/plugins/ directory.

2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress.

3. Use the 'Settings' menu in WordPress to configure the tag how you want it to work.

4. Use the 'Widgets' menu in WordPress to place the tag wherever you want it to appear.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= What is HIP? =

HIP is short for The Human Information Project.  It is a publicly available system that let's you store data about your users into a "profile system".  With this data you read it back later to do cool things, and you can sell it directly to third parties for advertising much like you may currently show ads on your site to your users to make extra money.

= How Do I Make Money? =

You put the HIP Tag (Wordpress plugin) on your site and we gather data on your users for you.  This data belngs to you, and to the users.  We can sell this data to advertisrs to target your users, much like Google does already if you use AdSense to show Google ads.  Unlike ads though HIP does not take up real estate on your site, and does interfere with any ads you currently may run.  HIP is a totally new revenue stream for your site.

In short HIP is like any normal advertising program like AdSense where your site shows an ad and you get paid.  The only difference is that here you are selling data instead of ad space.  Advertisers are interested in your user data to find users that may be interested in their products, brands and offers.

= I don't want to sell my user data =

No problem, just turn it off and the data stored is available only to you for analytical purposes and/or to use on your site to provide a better experience for users.

= How do I see my UPS data?  =

You must go to thehumaninformationproject.com and sign up.  Then you can verify your site so we know you are the legitimate owner.  Once that is done you have a username and password and you can login to keep track and of UPS system and manage it however you choose.
